# GitHub Release action

GitHub action that deploys files as a release.

This action uses [ghr](https://github.com/tcnksm/ghr).

## Usage

You provide a source directory from which all files need to be uploaded to your release, by default this is `output`.

```hcl
workflow "Deploy to GitHub Release" {
  on = "push"
  resolves = ["Deploy"]
}

action "Deploy" {
  uses = "ArjenSchwarz/actions/github/release@master"
  secrets = ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
  args = "-delete"
  env = {
      ONLY_IN_BRANCH="master"
      SOURCE_PATH="dist"
      VERSION="latest"
  }
}
```

Arguments you provide will be parsed as options for ghr. Look at [the documentation](https://github.com/tcnksm/ghr#options) for their meaning.
